# Getting Started

![Overview](/overview.png)

In this section, we will build in three parts.
- Job Manager (Kiribi worker): The center of the overview diagram
  - Receives and manages job queues
- Performer (Job processing worker): The lower part of the overview diagram
  - Processes job queues
- Enqueuer (Job enqueuing worker): The upper part of the overview diagram
  - Enqueues job queues

## 1. Create a Job Manager (Kiribi worker)

Use `create-cloudflare-cli` (C3) to build the base worker.<br>
You will be asked for the project name, so feel free to set it as you like.

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --ts --type=hello-world
```

Install `kiribi` in the directory of the created project.

```bash
npm install kiribi
```

Create a D1 database and a queue for Kiribi.<br>
You can set the database name and queue name as you like, but please copy the `database_id` displayed as it will be used in later steps.

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create kiribi-db
# copy the database_id
```

```bash
npx wrangler queues create kiribi-queue
```

Update `wrangler.toml` as follows:

```toml
name = "my-kiribi" # set the name of your worker freely
compatibility_date = "2024-04-03"
main = "src/index.ts"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "KIRIBI_DB" # Be sure to set KIRIBI_DB for the d1 database binding
database_name = "kiribi-db" # The name of the d1 database you created
database_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" # The database_id of the d1 database you created
migrations_dir = './node_modules/kiribi/migrations'

[[queues.producers]]
binding = "KIRIBI_QUEUE" # Be sure to set KIRIBI_QUEUE for the queue binding
queue = "kiribi-queue" # The name of the queue you created

[[queues.consumers]]
queue = "kiribi-queue" # The name of the queue you created
max_retries = 5

[[services]]
binding = "KIRIBI" # Be sure to set KIRIBI for the service binding
service = "my-kiribi" # same as `name`
```

::: info
`max_retries` is a hard limit for the job retry setting. Please set it with some margin.<br>
For example, if `max_retries` is 5, the number of retries will be 4.
:::

Migrate the database.

If you want to run it locally:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply kiribi-db --local
```

If you want to run it remotely:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply kiribi-db --remote
```

Update the worker code in `src/index.ts`.

```typescript
import { Kiribi } from 'kiribi'

export default class extends Kiribi {}
```

Deploy the worker.

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

:::info
If you deploy the worker for the first time, you may encounter an error like the following.

```
âœ˜ [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts/xxxxxxxxx/workers/scripts/my-kiribi) failed.

  workers.api.error.service_binding_error: could not resolve binding "KIRIBI": script
  "my-kiribi" not found [code: 10143]
```
If you encounter this error, comment out `[[services]]` in `wrangler.toml`, deploy, and then uncomment and deploy again.

```toml
[[services]]                                                        // [!code --]
binding = "KIRIBI" # Be sure to set KIRIBI for the service binding  // [!code --]
service = "my-kiribi"                                               // [!code --]
# [[services]]                                                      // [!code ++]
# binding = "KIRIBI"                                                // [!code ++]
# service = "my-kiribi"                                             // [!code ++]
```

## 2. Create Performers (Job processing workers)

Create a worker to process jobs enqueued in Kiribi.<br>
You can add this worker to the Kiribi worker created in the previous step, or you can create it as a separate worker.<br>

### Case of adding to the Kiribi worker

Add the following to `src/index.ts`.

```typescript
import { Kiribi } from 'kiribi'
import { KiribiPerformer } from 'kiribi/performer' // [!code ++]

export default class extends Kiribi {}

export class MyPerformer extends KiribiPerformer { // [!code ++]
  async perform(payload) {                         // [!code ++]
    // Do something with the payload               // [!code ++]
    console.log('perform', payload)                // [!code ++]
  }                                                // [!code ++]
}                                                  // [!code ++]
```

For more information on `perform`, click [here](/how-to-use).

Add the following to `wrangler.toml`.

```toml
name = "my-kiribi"
compatibility_date = "2024-04-03"
main = "src/index.ts"

# ...Omitted...

[[services]]
binding = "KIRIBI"
service = "my-kiribi"

[[services]]                                                    // [!code ++]
binding = "MY_JOB" # You can name the binding whatever you want // [!code ++]
service = "my-kiribi" # same as `name`                          // [!code ++]
entrypoint = "MyPerformer" # the name of exported class         // [!code ++]
```

### Case of creating a separate worker

If you want to separate the processing system from the Kiribi worker, do the following.<br>
For example, create a worker named `my-performing-worker`.
(The method of creating a worker is omitted.)

Update the `src/index.ts` of `my-performer-worker` as follows.

```typescript
import { KiribiPerformer } from 'kiribi/performer'

// There must be at least one default export
export default class extends KiribiPerformer {
  async perform(payload) {
    // Do something with the payload
    console.log('perform', payload)
  }
}

// Add other workers as needed
export class FooPerformer extends KiribiPerformer {
  async perform(payload) {
    // Do something with the payload
    console.log('perform', payload)
  }
}
```

Add the following to the `wrangler.toml` of the Kiribi worker (`my-kiribi`).

```toml
name = "my-kiribi"
compatibility_date = "2024-04-03"
main = "src/index.ts"

# ...Omitted...

[[services]]
binding = "KIRIBI"
service = "my-kiribi"

[[services]]                                                        // [!code ++]
binding = "MY_JOB" # You can name the binding whatever you want     // [!code ++]
service = "my-performing-worker" # The name of the performer worker // [!code ++]
                                                                    // [!code ++]
[[services]]                                                        // [!code ++]
binding = "FOO_JOB"                                                 // [!code ++]
service = "my-performing-worker"                                    // [!code ++]
entrypoint = "FooPerformer" # the name of exported class            // [!code ++]
```

## 3. Create Enqueuers (Job enqueuing workers)

Create a worker to enqueue jobs in Kiribi.<br>
The method of creating a worker is omitted.

Update the `wrangler.toml` of the worker as follows.

```toml
name = "my-enqueuing-worker"
compatibility_date = "2024-04-03"
main = "src/index.ts"

[[services]]
binding = "KIRIBI" # Be sure to set KIRIBI for the service binding
service = "my-kiribi" # The name of the Kiribi worker
```


```typescript
import { Kiribi } from 'kiribi'

interface Env {
  KIRIBI: Service<Kiribi>
}

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    // Enqueue a job
    await env.KIRIBI.enqueue('MY_JOB', { key: 'value' })

    return new Response('OK')
  }
}
```
